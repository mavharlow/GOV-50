# Question 1

# Step 1: Install the required packages (you only need to run this once)
install.packages("gapminder")
install.packages("tidyverse")

# Step 2: Load the libraries
library(gapminder)
library(tidyverse)

# Step 3: Inspect the gapminder dataset
glimpse(gapminder)

# Explanation
The Gapminder dataset contains 1,704 rows and 6 columns. The variables `country` and `continent` are factors, while `year`, `lifeExp`, `pop`, and `gdpPercap` are numerical variables.

# Question 2

# Step 1: Load the required libraries (repeating for practice)
library(gapminder)
library(tidyverse)

# Step 2: Create a boxplot of life expectancy by continent
plot_q2 <- ggplot(gapminder, aes(x = continent, y = lifeExp)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  labs(title = "Life Expectancy by Continent", 
       x = "Continent", 
       y = "Life Expectancy (years)") +
  theme_minimal()

# Step 3: Print the plot
plot_q2

# Step 4: Explanation
The boxplot above shows the distribution of life expectancy across the continents. Each box represents the interquartile range (IQR) of life expectancy for countries within a continent, and the horizontal line inside each box represents the median life expectancy.

# Question 3

The continent of Oceania has the highest median life expectancy. On the box plot, we can see that the horizontal line within the interquartile range of Oceania has the largest y-value among all of the other continents included in the graph, so Oceania has the highest median life expectancy.

In short, we can determine the median from the boxplot by looking at the horizontal line inside each box, which represents the median value for each continent.

# Question 4 

# Step 1: Create a line plot of life expectancy over time
plot_q4 <- ggplot(gapminder, aes(x = year, y = lifeExp, group = country)) +
  geom_line(color = "gray70") + 
  geom_smooth(aes(group = continent, color = continent), method = "loess", 
              se = FALSE, size = 1.1) +   # Corrected `se = FALSE`
  facet_wrap(~continent, nrow = 1) +
  labs(title = "Life expectancy on Five Continents over Time",
       x = "Year", y = "Life expectancy at birth in years") + 
  theme_minimal()

# Step 2: Print the plot
plot_q4
